                <p class="content">Edvard Munch (12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian painter and
                    printmaker whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main
                    tenets of late 19th-century Symbolism and greatly influenced German Expressionism in the early 20th
                    century. His best known work is The Scream, painted in 1893.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="content">Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of Ådalsbruk in Løten, United Kingdoms of Sweden
                    and Norway, to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a
                    doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder
                    sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie.
                    Laura was artistically talented and may have encouraged Edvard and Sophie. Edvard was related to
                    painter Jacob Munch and to historian Peter Andreas Munch
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="content">
                    The family moved to Christiania (renamed Kristiania in 1877, and now Oslo) in 1864 when Christian
                    Munch was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress. Edvard's mother died of tuberculosis in
                    1868, as did Munch's favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877. After their mother's death, the
                    Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the
                    winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his
                    school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and
                    entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer Edgar Allan Poe.

                    <div id="gridVsFlex" style="display: none">
                        <p class="content"><strong>CSS-grid</strong></p>
                        <p class="content">The CSS Grid Layout Module offers offers a grid-based layout system where
                            you order your page in rows and columns. This makes the web page much easier to design
                            instead of having to use floats and positioning.
                            <br/>A grid layout consists of what you can call a grid-container with several grid-items
                            inside of it. These items inside would be the grid content, and can also consists of new
                            grids, this is what we would have called a nested grid.
                            <br/>A feature to notice here is that a grid is making a 2D layout, that is, we have rows
                            and columns. This is in contrast to flexbox which we are going to talk about next.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="content"><strong>Flexbox</strong></p>
                        <p class="content">The Flexible Box Layout Module also makes is easier to flexible responsive
                            layout structures without the use of floats and positioning.<br/>
                            In the same way as a grid, we have what we would call a flex-container, which is like the
                            parent div. The container consists of several items which will be ordered either vertically
                            or horizontally.
                            <br/>As you can see flexbox is just going in one dimension, either a row or a column.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="content">So, the biggest difference between a grid and a flexbox is the dimension.
                            You can make the same layout with both a grid and a flexbox. You could for example just make
                            a vertical flexbox inside every item in a horizontally flexbox, and then you will have a
                            grid. Choose which ever fits your page best. You can guess how i made this documentation page</p>

                        <p class="content"><strong>Canvas</strong></p>
                        <p class="content">A canvas is just a container element where we can draw new graphics on the
                            fly. You do not write html code to add graphic to a canvas, you will have to use JavaScript.
                            Canvas has different methods for adding rectangles and circles, and you are also able to
                            draw your own kind of shapes. </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="content"><strong>SVG</strong></p>
                        <p class="content">SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, which is good because that means
                            that you can scale it how much you want while retaining the same quality. So elements like
                            this are used to define vector elements on a webpage, and the way that this is defined is
                            in XML. XML is just another markup language, and I will not focus on that here. <br/>
                            So SVG works in some way like a canvas, you have to define an area where there can be added
                            SVG graphic, but all this is written in the HTML file. This means that every SVG element
                            can have its own id, which makes it possible to search for in a document.
                        </p>

                        <p class="content">So, what is the biggest difference here? SVG elements are searchable because
                            they can have their own id. Drawings in a canvas will not have this option. They way that
                            I made it possible to change speed and colors of drawings in my canvas, is by using saving
                            information about them in different objects. I then iterate trough a list of objects
                            looking for the attributes that I want to change. With an SVG element, I could have found
                            them instantly. <br/>
                            It is also much easier to make a lot of elements in a canvas then with SVG, because I can
                            just script it as I did in canvas.js.

                        <p class="content">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
                            traversing trough HTML documents much easier with an API that works across multiple
                            browsers. Stuff like manipulating, event handling, animation and Ajax is also made
                            easy-to-use in jQuery. The basic syntax is $(selector).action, where $ actually just
                            stands for jQuery, and the selector is the element you want to perform the action on</p>
                            <br/>
                        <p class="content">
                            In my project the main usage of jQuery has been to traverse the document to find
                            elements with a specific class or id. With these elements I have just added click events,
                            but also on the colorPickers a made changed the oninput function with use of jQuery.
                            So every time I would like to reference a element in the HTML file, I used jQuery to
                            find it basically.
                        </p>
                            <br/>
                        <p class="content">
                            For this small project I have not had much usage of all that jQuery has to offer. Maybe
                            it would have looked different if I had used SVG and could have used jQuery´s ability to
                            animate with css-styling. But the main element of my website is the canvas, which is all
                            JavaScript objects. jQuery also makes it easy to show and hide elements, which I
                            am using here yo show and hide content in the documentation. This is just one of the event
                            functions that jQuery has, but since I have used it several times I thought it would be
                            nice to mention. All it really does is changing the display value in the css, which could
                            have been done without the jQuery.

                        was the colorPicker. If you open this page in Chrome you will see that the colorPickers actually
                        makes it possible to pick colors from a selection of colors. In Safari the colorPicker is
                        just a normal input field. Here you will have to manually write the color code, but this
                        also works fine on my website. </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="content">This was just one example of why you should test in different browsers.
                        So one thing is the appearance of the website, but another is the functionality. Just as humans
                        interpret things differently, so do browsers when reading code. So the goal of doing
                        cross-browser testing is to ensure that the user are able to access all the content and execute
                        all the different functions your website has to offer without any major issues or sacrifices</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="content">So what have I done to test that this page is working as it should?
                        As i mentioned above with the colorPicker, I opened the page in two different browsers, Safari
                        and Chrome. Here I first looked at all the visuals, like shapes, colors and resizing. Next
                        I checked if all the function that I was able to do in Chrome, also worked in Safari. Functions
                        like changing the color of figures in the canvas, and changing the speed in both x and y
                        directions.</p>
